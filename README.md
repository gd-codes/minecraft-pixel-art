_Create an add-on for the popular game Minecraft (Bedrock Edition) based on any image file on your PC, that can "build" it in a minecraft world to recreate the image as pixel art on a map !_

This is a complete GUI application written in Python 3, using `tkinter` for the GUI and and the `PIL` (`Pillow`) module for image processing. Run the program and read the detailed How-to in the app menu for more details !
(If you don't have Python installed, get it from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.7 or greater for your PC) and follow the installation steps, or follow any guide on installing Python. This will include `tkinter` by default. Then [install the `PIL` module](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.1.x/installation.html) and run **main.py** from the default IDLE editor or the command prompt.
